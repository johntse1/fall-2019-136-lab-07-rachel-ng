# Review for: Rachel Ng
# Reviewer: Vasyl Ilnytskyy

    Rachel's code is a well formatted and unqie approach to this lab with the 
inclusion of functions recieveInput and recieveFile. Both functions aid Rachel in
successfully coding this lab in a "I didn't think of that" way.

    Rachel's code is to the point in the sense that you can easily infer the 
purpose of her code but informative comments would be appreciated. The effort she
put in to create multiple test cases for her main functions I infered to have
helped her code this lab.

    Overall, Rachel's code precisely executed the challenges of this lab while
introducing an alternative route in which to successfully code this lab.
