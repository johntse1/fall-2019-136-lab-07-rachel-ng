- Makefile: I think main usually comes first
- tests.cpp: the indentation is off 

- I liked how she handled actions in separate functions. 
- I think it would have been better if she had made another function for formatting the code at the end, rather than doing it in main, and it would've allowed her to write test cases for them as well.
